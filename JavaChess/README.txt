  
    This file is designed to run a game of chess
    through the users terminal.
    
    To move a piece, you must enter it's coordinate (ex: "A1")
    with exactly one uppercase letter (A-H) and one integer (1-8)
    followed by the coordinate of the space you wish to move
    the piece to.
    
    WARNING: there are a small number of features yet to be implemented.
    
    The game is yet to be able to determine when a player has won
    or when the game is a draw; therefore, I have added the ability 
    to concede in order to terminate the program and declare a winner.
    
    One feature not yet implemented is capturing en passant.
    This move will never register as valid in the pawn pathing 
    and legal moving algorithms.
    
    The final work to be done is implementing a GUI.
    This program is entirely composed of logic I learned
    from CS180 class (my first time learning code), and, 
    therefore, I have only built this program using 
    what I learned entirely from that class.
    
    Things are likely not efficient. Things are likely completely wrong.
    I built this as a learning experience to teach myself the basics of
    Java and to have something fun I can play around with.
